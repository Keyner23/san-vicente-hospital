# üè• San Vicente Hospital - Console App

## üìñ Overview

- Create and manage **Appointments** linking patients and doctors
- Change appointment status (**Assigned**, **Attended**, **Cancelled**)
- Validations:
  - A patient or doctor cannot have more than one active appointment.
  - Patient email must include `@`.
- Send appointment confirmation emails via **SMTP**
